# Frontend - Angular Application

This is the frontend of a web application built using **Angular 20**. It interacts with a backend API (typically running on `http://localhost:3000`). Please ensure the backend server is up and running **before** starting this frontend project.

Before starting the frontend, ensure that the backend server is already running.

If you're using the [backend provided here](../backend/README.md), you can start it like this:

cd ../backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:4200
```

The Angular app will reload automatically on code changes.
